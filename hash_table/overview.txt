What is Hash Table?

hash tables DS stores elements in key value pairs. 
key= unique integer for indexing values. hashing function uses this key to generate the index.
value = data that are associated with keys.


Applications of Hash Table

1. constant time lookup and insertion is required
2. cryptographic applications
3. indexing data is required

NB: This majorly  used in databases

Hash collision
This  is the Limitations of Hash tables. This is when the hashing function generates the same index for multiple key.

solutions
    1. Chaining
    2. Open Addressing : Linear, Quadratic and Double Hashing

Hashing functions
    1. Division Method
    2. Multiplication Method
    3. Universal Hashing

comparism: Arrays and Hash tables time complexity
                Arrays  Hash Tables
search           O(n)    O(1)
lookup           0(1)    O(1)
push             0(1)    O(1)
insert           O(n)    O(1)
delete           O(n)    O(1)


NB: 
    1. These are  majorly  used in databases
    2. These are used where CRUD operations is needed.

Disadvantages of Hash_tables:
    They are unordered.
