linked list

A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node

You have to start somewhere, so we give the address of the first node a special name called HEAD. Also, the last node in the linked list can be identified because its next portion points to NULL.


 # visual algorithm
    - Provides a GUI for understanding linkedlist.

Advantage of a linkedlist.
    - data is arranged when compared to hash table
    - insertion is better than that of an array

Time complexity
    prepend O(1)
    append  O(1)
    lookup  O(1)
    insert  O(n)
    delete  O(n)

Pointer
    A reference to an object in memory.

    a = 'bay'
    b = a # b is a pointer to memory space of a
